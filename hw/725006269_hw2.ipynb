    "## A Twitter-Mentioning Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we're going to adapt the classic PageRank approach to allow us to find not the most authoritative web pages, but rather to find significant Twitter users. So, instead of viewing the world as web pages with hyperlinks (where pages = nodes, hyperlinks = edges), we're going to construct a graph of Twitter users and their mentions of other Twitter users (so user = node, mention of another user = edge). Over this Twitter-user graph, we can apply the PageRank approach to order the users. The main idea is that a user who is mentioned by other users is more \"impactful\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a toy example. Suppose you are given the following four tweets:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **userID**: diane, **text**: \"@bob Howdy!\"\n",
    "* **userID**: charlie, **text**: \"Welcome @bob and @alice!\"\n",
    "* **userID**: bob, **text**: \"Hi @charlie and @alice!\"\n",
    "* **userID**: alice, **text**: \"Howdy!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four short tweets generated by four users. The @mentions between users form a directed graph with four nodes and five edges. E.g., the \"diane\" node has a directed edge to the \"bob\" node. Note that a retweet also contain the \"@\", so it should be counted as a mention as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should build a graph by parsing the tweets in the file we provide called *pagerank.json*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The edges are binary and directed. If Bob mentions Alice once, in 10 tweets, or 10 times in one tweet, there is an edge from Bob to Alice, but there is not an edge from Alice to Bob.\n",
    "* If a user mentions herself, ignore it.\n",
    "* Correctly parsing @mentions in a tweet is error-prone. Use the entities field.\n",
    "* Later you will need to implement the PageRank algorithm on the graph you build here.\n"

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints**:\n",
    "* If you're using the matrix style approach, you should use [numpy.matrix](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.matrix.html).\n",
    "* Scipy is built on top of Numpy and has support for sparse matrices. You most likely will not need to use Scipy unless you'd like to try out their sparse matrices.\n",
    "* If you choose to use Numpy (and Scipy), please make sure your Anaconda environment include their latest versions (Numpy 1.12.0; Scipy 0.18.1).\n",
    "* Test your parsing and PageRank calculations using a handful of tweets, before moving on to the entire file we provide.\n",
